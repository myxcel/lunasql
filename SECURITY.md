# Security policy

## Supported versions

LunaSQL is supported on a best endeavors basis. Patches will be applied to the *latest version* rather than retroactively to other versions. Please make sure you always have the [latest release](https://github.com/myxcel/lunasql/releases/latest).

## Reporting a vulnerability

Whilst I aim to write clean and secure code free from bugs and security issues, I am not perfect, this project is written in my spare time and it relies on external libraries.

In many scenarios, the most appropriate way to report a vulnerability is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/myxcel/lunasql/issues/new/choose) describing the problem in as much details as possible.

This will obviously be *public*. If you feel that the vulnerability is significant enough to warrant a private disclosure, please create an [advisory](https://github.com/myxcel/lunasql/security/advisories/new), or report it by email (base64-encoded `aXNzdWVAbWljYWVsLnVuYm94LmF0`, decode it [here](https://it-tools.tech/base64-string-converter)).

If you choose to send an e-mail, you can decide to encrypt with my key [466F B094 B95C 3589](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/myxcel/8dc88878af2eea1d02e52ae55c694fc0/raw/myxcel-466FB094B95C3589.asc).

Thank you very much for your contribution! Your account will be credited in the acknowledgments section of this repository.
